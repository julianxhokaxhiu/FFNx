# FFNx

Next generation modding platform for Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII (with native Steam 2013 release support)

## Introduction

FFNx is a continuing evolution of the [FF7_OpenGL](https://github.com/Aali132/ff7_opengl) driver, [made by Aali](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=14922.0).

FFNx today in a nutshell:

- Uses an easy, drag-n-drop installation experience, see [How to Install](docs/how_to_install.md)
- Comes built-in with 7th Heaven v2.3 and higher
- Supports the newest video and audio codecs (WEBM, H.265, Ogg, etc.)
- Drastically enhances the gameplay experience compared to the vanilla experience
- Provides four stable rendering backends:
  - DirectX 11 (default)
  - DirectX 12
  - Vulkan
  - OpenGL

## The Team

FFNx is developed by a core team, currently composed of:

- [Julian Xhokaxhiu](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu) (TrueOdin, ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain)
- [Tang-Tang Zhou](https://github.com/tangtang95) (vertex2995, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy)
- [JÃ©rÃ´me Arzel](https://github.com/myst6re) (myst6re, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France)
- [CosmosXIII](https://github.com/CosmosXIII) (Cosmos, ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japan)

We are always open for contributions via PRs, and in case you want to join the core team, feel free to approach us on Discord and we will evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

## How to build

Available build profiles:

- x86-Release (default, the same used to release artifacts in this Github page)
- x86-RelWithDebInfo (used while developing to better debug some issues)
- x86-MinSizeRel
- x86-Debug (prefer it if you want to use a debugger attached to the game)

Once the project is built you can find the output in this path: `.build/bin`
