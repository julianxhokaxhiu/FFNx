#[INTERNAL RESOLUTION SCALE]
# The scale is in multiples of 640x480
# The scale factor is used to multiply the internally used resolution to a given size before it is scaled to the final screen or window resolution.
# This is required to avoid visual glitches that may happen when the game is not rendered in a 4:3 aspect ratio.
# This is optional for native 4:3 resolutions, but it can enhance visual quality at values higher than the current screen or window resolution ( like Nvidia DSR ).

# - 2: 2x

#[GAME LIGHTING]
# This flag sets the method used to calculate the original game lighting.
# Available choices are:
# - 0: Original ( will inherit the default original CPU-based lighting of the PC version )
# - 1: Per-Vertex ( will calculate lighting in the GPU per-vertex and closely match the look of the PSX version )
# - 2: Per-Pixel ( same as above but calculates lighting per-pixel for a smoother result )

# This flag will set the brightness level that SDR "white" is rendered at within an HDR monitor.
# By default is set to 0, which means to attempt autodetection of the correct value for your monitor via software.
# Autodetection may fail on some monitor models.
# Autodetection WILL fail on Windows older than Win10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709).
# Autodetection WILL fail on WINE (at least as of WINE version 7.22).
# If autodetection is attempted and fails, a default value of 200 nits will be used.
# NOTE: FFNx.log will tell you if autodetection succeeded, and what value was autodetected.
# NOTE: The autodetected (or default) value MIGHT be wrong sometimes; use this flag if brightness does not look correct.
# Sane values are likely in the range 100-200 nits.

#[COLOR GAMUT]
# If enabled, performs a conversion to simulate the color gamut of the 1990s Japanese television sets that FF7 and FF8 were originally designed for.
# See docs/gamma_and_gamut.md for details.
# This mode is appropriate for:
# (1) Vanilla FF7/FF8.
# (2) Mod assets that are upscales of the original assets.
# (3) Mod assets made from scratch where the modder used the original assets as an uncorrected color reference.
# This mode is not appropriate for mod assets made from scratch that truly use the sRGB color gamut.
# Such assets can be made suitable for this mode using this converter program: https://github.com/ChthonVII/gamutthingy

# This flag will overwrite the internal FPS limiter of the game.
# Available choices are:
# - 0: Original ( will inherit the default vanilla game behavior, some bugs may appear )
# - 1: Default ( an hybrid mode that fixes most of the known game limiter bugs while preserving the original FPS )
# - 2: 30 FPS ( it will bump Battle mode to 30 FPS, everything else will run in vanilla mode )
# - 3: 60 FPS ( all the game will run in 60 FPS, use this option at your own risk )
