#[INTERNAL RESOLUTION SCALE]
# The scale is in multiples of 640x480
# The scale factor is used to multiply the internally used resolution to a given size before it is scaled to the final screen or window resolution.
# This is required to avoid visual glitches that may happen when the game is not rendered in a 4:3 aspect ratio.
# This is optional for native 4:3 resolutions, but it can enhance visual quality at values higher than the current screen or window resolution ( like Nvidia DSR ).
